# Multiplexed_image_analysis_pipeline
This pipeline consists of notebooks enabling in-depth analysis of multiplexed images.
The goal of this project is to enable detailed spatial interaction analysis from multiplexed imagery without programming knowledge.For this purpose, the pipeline is composed of Google Colab Notebooks.

The pipeline enables initial analysis steps such as image visualization, MFI calculation, clustering, and phenotype annotation. 
However, it also allows for more advanced analyses such as cell-cell interactions, neighborhood analysis, dense infiltrate segmentation, and fibrosis studies.

## Steps to follow to begin the analysis:
  * Download the pipeline folder from GitHub
  * Import this folder into your Google Drive
  * If you are working with 'mcd' format images, import them into the 'Pipeline/project/images/mcd' folder. If you are working with '.tiff' format images, import them into the 'Pipeline/project/images/raw' folder.
  * Rename the 'project' folder according to the name of your analysis project.
  * Open the first notebook, number 0, located in the 'pipeline/code' folder. Google Collaps notebooks are made up of cells that can be run by clicking on the triangle on the left.
